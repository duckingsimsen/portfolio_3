# portfolio_3
This is my first team project after joining a club called ASSEM\
I worked on this project as a team leader\
In this project, the front-end side was designed together and divided\
The backend finished the work alone\
The backend was made using the bulletin board used by portfolio_2\
The front end used swipe, double drop-down, and open menu techniques\
I took the swipe from the script and used it\
The double drop-down is set to have the effect of raising the mouse\
The open menu also used a scribe, and when you select a menu, the corresponding menu is set up\
The backend side is described in detail if you look at the portfolio_2 above\
